# About the Centre for Intelligent Solutions

## IISER Pune: a national hub for scientific excellence
The Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Pune is a premier institute dedicated to research and teaching in the basic sciences. Established in 2006 by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (now the Ministry of Education) and recognised as an Institute of National Importance in 2012, IISER Pune integrates state-of-the-art research with high-quality education. The institute nurtures curiosity, creativity, and integrity across departments spanning Biology, Chemistry, Data Science, Earth and Climate Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, Mathematics, Physics, and Science Education.

## The Centre for Intelligent Solutions (CIS)
Industry 4.0 demands a convergence of data, analytics, and connectivity. CIS channels IISER Pune’s scientific depth into industry-focused collaborations where digital transformation, AI, and quantum technologies meet real operational needs. We convene more than twenty researchers who specialise in data, algorithms, models, applied mathematics, computation, and simulation.

## Vision
- Provide a focused platform that builds sustained cooperation between industry and academia in data and analytics.
- Employ mathematical, simulation, and data science tools to solve problems relevant to industry.

## Mission
- Advance quantitative research that tackles practical industrial challenges.
- Spot emerging trends and ideas with immediate applicability.
- Sustain active collaborations with industry for mutual benefit.
- Plan and conduct activities that strengthen research and teaching in areas such as applied mathematics, data science, machine learning, and high-performance computing.
- Promote student interest and employability in these domains.
- Foster joint initiatives between academia and industry for broader social good.

## Why the centre matters now
Industry leaders rely on cutting-edge quantitative analysis to optimise productivity, efficiency, and decision-making. IISER Pune’s experts work daily with emerging ideas, while data-rich industries are eager to translate their information into impact. CIS creates the platform where these strengths meet, enabling co-created solutions that bridge mathematical rigour with industrial relevance.

## A platform for sustained collaboration
Through CIS, IISER Pune brings together applied mathematics, analytics, data science, computing, and simulation capabilities to address industry-focused problems. The centre is designed to catalyse collaborations across industry-academia and even industry-industry partnerships, ensuring that scientific innovation directly informs commercial success.
