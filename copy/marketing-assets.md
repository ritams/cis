Subject: Exploring a collaboration with IISER Pune's Centre for Intelligent Solutions

Hello [Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out on behalf of IISER Pune's Centre for Intelligent Solutions (CIS). We bring together more than twenty researchers who specialise in data science, simulation, quantum technologies, and applied mathematics to solve industry-scale challenges.

We noticed your organisation's focus on [relevant initiative], and we believe a joint project or exploratory engagement could unlock measurable outcomes. Our team can help scope the opportunity, align the right faculty experts, and deliver a roadmap that balances rapid experimentation with scientific rigor.

Would you be available for a 45-minute discovery meeting over the next two weeks? I would be glad to coordinate a time that fits your schedule.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
