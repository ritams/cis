# Domain Expertise

CIS accelerates outcomes by aligning IISER Pune's deep research strengths with industry-scale challenges. Explore the breadth of capabilities we deploy in joint projects, consultancy, and training engagements.

## Molecular dynamics
We conduct large-scale simulations across materials and biological systems—proteins, DNA, electrolytes, polymers—to evaluate feasibility before costly lab experiments. Techniques such as umbrella sampling, metadynamics, and thermodynamic integration deliver precise free-energy estimates that guide product development.

## Drug design
Our teams run AI-enabled docking studies and de novo drug design pipelines. RFdiffusion, AlphaFlow, and molecular dynamics simulations inform candidate prioritisation and free-energy calculations, helping you accelerate discovery cycles and improve hit quality.

## Machine learning
From deep learning and graph neural networks to reinforcement learning, we design specialised parallel algorithms tailored to scientific and industrial datasets. A dedicated high-performance computing facility powers scalable experimentation that translates into production-ready solutions.

## Quantum computing
IISER Pune leads national efforts in quantum innovation. We co-develop algorithms for optimisation, cryptography, privacy protection, high-precision sensing, and communication tasks where quantum approaches deliver transformative speedups.

## Urban data analytics
We leverage emerging datasets such as OpenStreetMap for route optimisation, location-aware services, and traffic simulations. Our models support mobility platforms, logistics networks, and city planners seeking data-driven operational improvements.

## Quantitative finance
We solve mathematical and statistical problems underlying fintech, derivatives pricing, portfolio optimisation, and credit risk evaluation. Industry partners tap into stochastic modelling, machine learning, and numerical methods to inform high-stakes financial decisions.

## Weather and climate data analytics
Our scientists model cloud organisation, extreme events, and monsoon variability. Collaborations span weather forecasting, disaster risk assessment, urban heat mitigation, agricultural advisory, and environmental consultancy—insights relevant to insurance, transportation, and energy sectors.

## Computational material science
We deliver predictive ab initio modelling and molecular dynamics simulations (ab initio, classical, QM/MM, path integral) to design novel materials. Tools include density functional theory, time-dependent DFT, kinetic Monte Carlo, and nudged elastic band simulations for properties across length and time scales.

## From data to information
We build high-performance computational pipelines for precision cosmology and other data-rich domains. Expertise covers parallel simulations across thousands of cores, bespoke statistical tools, and machine learning techniques that extract actionable patterns from massive datasets.

## Algorithms from wetware
By modelling neurobiological networks, we derive algorithms inspired by animal cognition for pattern recognition, navigation, and memory. Current initiatives include an electronic nose based on insect olfactory systems for detecting volatile biomarker signatures.

## Quantum materials and emergent phenomena
Advanced theoretical models and numerical simulations reveal the electronic, magnetic, and topological properties of quantum materials. We help partners manipulate strain, doping, and fields to guide experiments and prototype devices in quantum computing and spintronics.
