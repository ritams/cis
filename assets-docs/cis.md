## Domain expertise

### Molecular dynamics

For any industry application, simulations of complex processes are the first steps in any feasibility investigation before more expensive wet lab experiments are performed. Centre has extensive experience and expertise for carrying out large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of a variety of systems ranging from several classes of materials to biological systems. This includes simulations of proteins, DNA, protein-DNA interactions, electrolytes, polymers, etc. Even more sophisticated techniques, such as umbrella sampling, different versions of metadynamics, thermodynamic integration, etc. are carried out to obtain free energetic estimates of a process that is more accurate and match closely to experimental realisations. 

### Drug design

Computer-aided drug design is an integral part in the current approaches to drug design. The centre has expertise  to carry out various docking studies, de novo design of drug molecules, and test them computationally using MD simulations and free energy calculations. Our groups are adept at using AI-driven tools (such as RFdiffusion, AlphaFlow, etc.) that aid in the discovery of new drugs for a particular target.

### Machine learning

IISER Pune has expertise in various Machine Learning techniques. In our work, we employ deep learning, graph convolutional neural networks, LSTM, reinforcement learning, etc. We routinely develop new specialised parallel algorithms targeted towards a wide range of domains in the basic sciences as well as in applied fields. A dedicated high performance computing facility at IISER Pune caters to our infrastructural requirements. 

### Quantum computing 

This is one of the emerging areas that promises faster and efficient solutions for certain classes of problems in a wide range of industrial settings. This could include, but not limited to, supply-chain optimisation (and also most types of optimisation) problems, privacy protection, cryptography, high-precision sensing, and communications. IISER Pune leads India's efforts in this area and has a strong faculty strength and infrastructure in nearly all these areas.

### Urban data analytics

In the last one decade, many new tools and data sources such as OpenStreetMap have emerged that are of immense benefit in route planning and optimization, for mobile applications that require location-aware services (e.g., cab aggregators), and as a simulation tool to predict traffic and other tools of relevance in urban landscape.

### Quantitative finance

Decisions related to financial transactions taken by either commoners, market participants or regulators often depend on solutions to complex mathematical and statistical problems. Those include but are not limited to fintech applications, option pricing, financial portfolio optimization, credit risk evaluation, and many others. IISER Pune has mathematical and simulation expertise and industry experience in these areas.

### Weather and climate data analytics

Data analytics is an integral part of weather and climate studies. Mathematical and statistical models and machine learning approaches are used to work on problems ranging from cloud organisation, extreme heat and precipitation events and forecasting monsoon variability. Expertise in these areas will facilitate industry academia collaborations in areas such as weather forecasting, disaster risk assessment, urban heat island effects, agricultural advisory and environmental consultancy. Some of these products are useful for industries ranging from insurance to transportation.

### Computational material science

Microscopic understanding of material properties is imperative for in silico designing of novel materials. At IISER Pune there are expertise available to carry out large-scale density functional theory (both time-dependent and time-independent) based calculations, coupled with molecular dynamics simulations of different flavours, for eg. ab initio, classical and quantum mechanics molecular mechanics, path integral, etc. Additionally, we have expertise in performing nudged elastic band calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. Using these tools material properties across large length scales and long time scales can be extracted for practical applications.

### From data to information

In the current era of precision cosmology, international experiments are providing high quality and large volumes of data. The analysis and physical modelling of this data requires the development of computational and statistical tools at a scale that is unprecedented in order to answer fundamental questions. At IISER, we have expertise in multiple branches of this effort that can be leveraged for industry requirements: simulation techniques that employ high-performance computing through parallelisation over thousands of cores, developing novel statistical tools to extract specific patterns within the data, and applying cutting-edge machine learning  techniques to optimise the extraction of useful information from the vast amounts of raw data.

### Algorithms from wetware

Living systems may appear to be a soup of chemicals that interact in complex and unpredictable ways towards solving problems an animal encounters in its environment. Sub-cellular and intercellular interaction networks are wired in ways that solve many of these problems. Since these networks have evolved over billions of years, understanding how biological systems solve problems related to pattern recognition, pattern classification, navigation, memory storage and retrieval will provide insights into successful, perhaps optimal, biological algorithms to exploit complex information. We develop detailed and idealised models of neurobiological interaction networks at several scales that reveal how animals sense odours, navigate, remember, and recollect. Efforts are on to develop an electronic nose based on insect olfactory systems to detect a cocktail of volatile components in a person's breath that can be used to identify pathological states.

### Quantum materials and emergent phenomena 

Computational research is crucial for understanding the fundamental physics of quantum materials and designing them for applications in quantum computing, spintronics, and other advanced technologies. The IISER team specialises in advanced theoretical models and numerical simulations to obtain information about the electronic, magnetic, and topological properties of these materials. By manipulating parameters such as strain, doping, and external fields, researchers can predict material responses, guiding experimental efforts and the development of novel devices.
