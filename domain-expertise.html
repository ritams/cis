              <p>For any industry application, simulations of complex processes are the first steps in any feasibility investigation before more expensive wet lab experiments are performed. Centre has extensive experience and expertise for carrying out large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of a variety of systems ranging from several classes of materials to biological systems. This includes simulations of proteins, DNA, protein-DNA interactions, electrolytes, polymers, etc. Even more sophisticated techniques, such as umbrella sampling, different versions of metadynamics, thermodynamic integration, etc. are carried out to obtain free energetic estimates of a process that is more accurate and match closely to experimental realisations.</p>

              <p>In the current era of precision cosmology, international experiments are providing high quality and large volumes of data. The analysis and physical modelling of this data requires the development of computational and statistical tools at a scale that is unprecedented in order to answer fundamental questions. At IISER, we have expertise in multiple branches of this effort that can be leveraged for industry requirements: simulation techniques that employ high-performance computing through parallelisation over thousands of cores, developing novel statistical tools to extract specific patterns within the data, and applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques to optimise the extraction of useful information from the vast amounts of raw data.</p>

              <p>Living systems may appear to be a soup of chemicals that interact in complex and unpredictable ways towards solving problems an animal encounters in its environment. Sub-cellular and intercellular interaction networks are wired in ways that solve many of these problems. Since these networks have evolved over billions of years, understanding how biological systems solve problems related to pattern recognition, pattern classification, navigation, memory storage and retrieval will provide insights into successful, perhaps optimal, biological algorithms to exploit complex information. We develop detailed and idealised models of neurobiological interaction networks at several scales that reveal how animals sense odours, navigate, remember, and recollect. Efforts are on to develop an electronic nose based on insect olfactory systems to detect a cocktail of volatile components in a person's breath that can be used to identify pathological states.</p>
